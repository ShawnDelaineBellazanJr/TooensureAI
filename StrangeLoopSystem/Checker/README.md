# Checker Component

## Role
The Checker implements the 'maker-checker' pattern for reliability, providing output validation, quality assurance, and compliance checking.

## Implementation
- Uses separate models for validation versus generation to avoid bias.
- Incorporates confidence scoring and human-in-the-loop escalation for high-risk decisions.
