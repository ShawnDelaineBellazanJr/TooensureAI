# Planner Component

## Role
The Planner functions as the cognitive entry point, employing hierarchical task networks to decompose complex goals into manageable sub-tasks. It integrates with Semantic Kernel's planning capabilities for dynamic task orchestration while maintaining goal hierarchies and dependency graphs.

## Implementation
- Leverages LLMs for natural language interpretation.
- Uses structured planning languages for task decomposition.
